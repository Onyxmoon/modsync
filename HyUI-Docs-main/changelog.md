* Rework internally how logging occurs, it is now enabled in releases, at Finest level only.
* Add helper methods to ItemGridBuilder to update/remove/get all slots, the tutorial has also been updated to showcase this.
* Add support for replacing button builders for tab navigation - this complements the existing selected/unselected styling. Use `TabNavigationBuilder.addTab(id, label, contentId, buttonBuilder)` , this means every tab's button can have its own builder. By default, tabs are built with secondary/primary button builders. You can of course update/remove tabs as well.
* Add support for `CustomButtonBuilder` for tab navigation.
